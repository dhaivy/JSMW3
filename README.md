# JSMW3

This project is an example of a basic Web3 interaction that will allow users to connect their wallets and send funds to a specified wallet with a message on Testnet.

The specific testnet hasn't been decided yet. I'm going to try to be as thorough as possible with documentation to make the design as easy to understand as possible for learning purposes.

The objective of building this project is an attempt to understand proper project composition and gain exposure to Solidity and React.

Hopefully I retain any of the knowledge that will go into building this.
